# OpenAI Hub

OpenAI Hub is a robust and efficient tool designed to streamline and enhance your interaction with OpenAI's API. It features an innovative way to load balance multiple API keys, allowing users to make requests without needing individual OpenAI API keys. In addition, it employs a global access control list (ACL) that gives you the power to regulate which APIs and models users can utilize.

## Key Features
- **Load Balancing:** Utilize multiple API keys efficiently, preventing the overuse of any single key.
- **API Key Protection:** Allow users to make requests without the need for an individual OpenAI API key, enhancing security and ease of use.
- **Global ACL:** Regulate user access to specific APIs and models, ensuring the right people have access to the right resources.

## Upcoming Features (To-Do List)
- [x] **User Authentication:** We're working on introducing an authentication system for users to enhance the security and integrity of the application.
- [ ] **Per User/RBAC ACL:** We're developing a more granular access control system to allow permissions to be set on a per-user basis, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to allow users to have roles that define their access levels.
- [ ] **Access Log:** To help you keep track of usage, we plan to introduce an access log feature that will display token consumption statistics.

We're always working to improve OpenAI Hub and add new features. Stay tuned for these exciting updates!
