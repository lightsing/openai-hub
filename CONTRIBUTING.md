## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under The MIT Software License

## Report Bugs Using Github's [Issues](https://github.com/lightsing/openai-hub/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write Bug Reports With Detail, Background, And Sample Code
Here's an example of a bug report:

> **Short and descriptive example bug report title**
>
> **A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps to reproduce the bug**
>
> 1. First step
> 2. Second step
> 3. And so on...
>
> **Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).**
